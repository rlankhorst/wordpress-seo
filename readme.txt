### Premium support

The Yoast team does not always provide active support for the Yoast SEO plugin on the WordPress.org forums, as we prioritize our email support. One-on-one email support is available to people who [bought Yoast SEO Premium](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/) only.

Note that the [Yoast SEO Premium](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) also has several extra features too, including the option to have multiple focus keywords, internal linking suggestions, cornerstone content checks and a redirect manager, so it is well worth your investment!

You should also check out the [Yoast Local SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/local-seo/), [Yoast News SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/) and [Yoast Video SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/video-seo/) extensions to Yoast SEO. They work with the free version of Yoast SEO already, and these premium extensions of course come with support too.
